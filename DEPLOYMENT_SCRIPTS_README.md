## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before using any deployment script, ensure you have:

### Optional (depending on deployment method)
- **Firebase CLI** (auto-installed by scripts if needed)
- **Docker Desktop** (for Docker deployments) - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## üîß Setup Instructions

### First Time Setup

1. **Clone or navigate to your project directory**
2. **Set up environment variables** (if using Firebase):
   - Create a `.env` file in your project root
   - Add your Firebase configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init
   ```

## üì± Deployment Options Explained

### 1. Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
- **Best for**: Production deployments, easy scaling, global CDN
- **What it does**: Builds your app and deploys to Firebase Hosting
- **URL**: You'll get a URL like `https://your-project.web.app`
- **Cost**: Free tier available, pay-as-you-scale

### 2. Docker Deployment
- **Best for**: Server deployments, containerized environments
- **Options**:
  - **Single Container**: Runs just your app
  - **Docker Compose**: Runs app + nginx reverse proxy
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or your server IP)

### 3. Build Only
- **Best for**: Manual deployments, custom hosting
- **What it does**: Creates a `dist` folder with production-ready files
- **Next steps**: Upload the `dist` folder to any web server

### 4. Development Server
- **Best for**: Local testing, development
- **What it does**: Starts a local development server
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Node.js not found"
```bash
# Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
# Restart your terminal after installation
node --version  # Should show version number
```

#### "Firebase CLI not found"
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login
```

#### "Docker not found"
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running
docker --version  # Should show version number
```

#### "Permission denied" (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Run this command first to allow script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### Firebase deployment fails
1. Make sure you're logged in: `firebase login`
2. Check if project is initialized: `firebase projects:list`
3. Verify your `firebase.json` configuration
4. Ensure your project has hosting enabled in Firebase Console

#### Build fails
1. Check your environment variables in `.env`
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm ci`
3. Try clearing node modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`
